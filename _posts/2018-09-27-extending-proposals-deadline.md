### If you are still considering

JupyterDay in the Triangle is an event bringing together members of the community using and contributing to the popular open-source Project Jupyter. The event will be an engaging mix of talks, discussions, and birds of a feather sessions on topics spanning the full ecosystem of Jupyter, including major components like the widely used Jupyter Notebook as well as the project’s underlying architecture and tools.
