### Over twenty talks accepted to JupyterDay in the Triangle

Thank you to all that submitted their talk proposals! The organizers decided to forgo the birds of a feather sessions and  make room for more short-form talks, allowing us to host over twenty speakers for the day. The JupyterDay event on November 13th will give us a chance to see even more of the Jupyter-related work that is happening in the greater Triangle. 

Have a look at our full program schedule for November 13th and welcome all the amazing speakers that will be presenting.
