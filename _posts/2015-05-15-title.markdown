### Announcing Jupyter in the Triangle & call for proposals

We’re excited to announce the next Jupyter Pop-up event! Join us for Jupyter in the Triangle in Chapel Hill, NC, November 13, 2018. The event will be hosted at the Carolina Club, and is organized by the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Libraries. This event is being co-organized with core Jupyter Project contributors, some of whom will be present.

### What is it?

Jupyter in the Trinagle is a "Pop-up" event on the popular open-source Jupyter Project, including major components like the widely used Jupyter Notebook as well as the project’s underlying architecture and tools. The event will be an engaging mix of talks, discussions, and birds of a feather sessions on topics spanning the full ecosystem of Jupyter. The theme of the event focuses on the work of * Early Career Researchers & Data Scientists * and we are hoping for contributions from this group, but are open to all contributions. We are also focused on creating a welcoming environment that fosters diversity and inclusion in the broad spectrum of projects and ideas that will be discussed.
