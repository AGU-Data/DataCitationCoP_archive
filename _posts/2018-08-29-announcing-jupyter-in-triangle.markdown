### Announcing JupyterDay in the Triangle & Call for Proposals

We’re excited to announce the next JupyterDay event! Join us for JupyterDay in the Triangle in Chapel Hill, NC, November 13, 2018. The event will be hosted at the Carolina Club, and is organized by the University Libraries at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,. This event is co-organized with core Project Jupyter contributors, some of whom will be present.

### What is it?

JupyterDay in the Triangle is an event bringing together members of the community using and contributing to the popular open-source [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). The event will be an engaging mix of talks, discussions, and [birds of a feather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)) sessions on topics spanning the full ecosystem of Jupyter, including major components like the widely used Jupyter Notebook as well as the project’s underlying architecture and tools. The theme of the event focuses on the work of *Early Career Researchers & Data Scientists*. We are hoping for contributions from this group, but are open to all contributions. We are also focused on creating a welcoming environment that fosters diversity and inclusion in the broad spectrum of projects and ideas that will be discussed.
