### Morning Announcements

  * Help for people that want to start using or contributing to Jupyter at the end of the day
  * Use #trianglejupyter for social media

### Long Talks

Long talks should last between 20 and 25 minutes. We must move from one long talk to the next every 30 minutes to stay on schedule!

* Long talks should have a timekeeper which can be a session helper or the MC.
* The timekeeper should identify themselves to speakers so they know where to look for time signals.
* The MC should briefly introduce the speaker.
* The timekeeper should let the presenter know when 20 minutes are up.
* The timekeeper should have the presenter wrap-up when 25 minutes are up or play an audible alarm.
* The MC should field questions from the audience at the end of the talk, but leave enough time for the next speaker to setup.

### Lightning Talks

Lightning talks should last between 5 and 8 minutes. We must move from one lightning talk to the next every 10 minutes to stay on schedule!

* Lightning talks should have a timekeeper which can be a session helper or the MC.
* The timekeeper should identify themselves to speakers so they know where to look for time signals.
* The MC should ask the audience to hold questions until the end of each talk.
* The MC should very briefly introduce the lightning talk speaker.
* The timekeeper should signal when 5 minutes are up.
* The timekeeper should have a device (laptop, phone) that plays a loud alarm when 8 minutes are up.
* The MC should field a question or two from the audience while the speaker unplugs their device and the next speaker sets up.
* If the presenter struggles to get their presentation showing, the MC should ask the presenter to step off stage, work with the A/V profesional, and try again at the end of the block of talks.

### Lunch Announcements

* Diveplane will be giving demos at a table by registration.
* Reminder for presenters to link their slides from the JupyterDay site (PR or post a link somewhere anyone else can do it)
* #trianglejupyter for social media

### Closing Announcements

* Thanks for coming
* Please fill out a questionnare on JupyterDay in the Triangle website to help us plan and improve upon potential future events
* Reminder that Pete, Tony, (anyone else who wants to help) will be available until 6 PM to help anyone that would like to get starting using or contributing to Jupyter.
